              <h5>Electron tomography is a form of transmission electron microscopy in which a sample is tilted during imaging, typically one or two degrees between images, building up a "tilt-series" of images that can be computationally reconstructed into a 3D view of the sample, or "tomogram." In essence, electron tomography takes a CT scan of a cell.</h5>

            <GridItem xs={12} sm={12} md={6}>
              <h5>Currently, the majority of tomograms in the ETDB were acquired by cryo-EM, in which cells in standard growth media are plunged into a cryogen that freezes them so rapidly that the water molecules don't have a chance to rearrange into a crystalline lattice, preserving cell structures in vitreous, or glass-like, amorphous ice. Vitrified cells can be imaged directly by electron tomography, without the need for fixation, dehydration, resin-embedding or staining. This captures the cells in an essentially native state.</h5>
